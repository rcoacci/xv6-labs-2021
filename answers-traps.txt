1) function arguments go in a0-a7. 13 is in a2 (3rd argument).
2) Those calls are inlined. In the call to printf, the compiler "called" f in compile time and inlined the result directly.
3) 0x0628
4) 0x0038
5) HE110 World. Yes.
6) It will print garbage, because it's missing the second argument, so whatever is in a1 will be printed.
